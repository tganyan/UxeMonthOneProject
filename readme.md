# AFOMO
## Find local events quickly and easily

AFOMO is a web app that enables the user to quickly locate events in their area and filter the results by proximity or event type (music, art, theatre, etc.).

There is a simple log-in process that enables the user to save and share events with their friends. Upon logging in, the user will be presented with search options to quickly bring up events around them. Selecting an event will let the user see a brief description of the event, a picture, and options to save the event or share it with friends or even buy tickets if applicable.
